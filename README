This program displays balls bouncing, which make noise 
as they bounce. They then send a signal to ChucK, which
outputs a sound. 
Before starting the program, run 
chuck --loop & 
chuck + testSound.ck
then run the java program. 

The code to connect to chuck is not uploaded yet! 
Here is only the code for the bouncing balls. 
It will be necessary to have ChucK installed to run the 
program.

The point of the program is to produce semi-natural random
ness and be a kind of random, but adjustable sound-tool,
where the output sounds can be chosen and possibly 
edited with in some ways (for reverb, pitch et.c).
